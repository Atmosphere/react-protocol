GitHub Issue Tracker is used to track bug reports, feature requests and pull requests only. If your issue is a question or problem, post it to [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vibe).

Before opening a new issue, please check if the same issue already has been reported.

For a complicated bug, please make sure to specify the followings. The less informations you provided, the lower priority it will get.

* Vibe version
* What you were trying to
* Bare minimum steps or code to reproduce
* Result with the latest version
* Result with an older version
* Anything where you think it's relevant

For a complicated and time consuming work like introducing new feature, we need to discuss it first enough for you to avoid wasting too much time and to lead the project to the way we all desire.
